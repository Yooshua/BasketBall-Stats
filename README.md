# Basketball Team Stats Tool
I didn't see the purpose of creating a class for the stats.
Also to me, a 'clean players' function doesn't really do anything, but I'm a noob :D

Also I think it would work if you added players and teams. I didn't want to hardcode teams 1,2,3.

Very challenging and fun!
